**Bootstrap Migration (This Repo):** https://github.com/k7le-777/safa-hearts-bootstrap

## Live Sites

**Vanilla CSS Version:** https://k7le-777.github.io/safa-hearts/  
**Bootstrap Version (This Site):** https://k7le-777.github.io/safa-hearts-bootstrap/

## Migration Complete ✅

All components successfully migrated to Bootstrap while maintaining brand identity.

### Bootstrap Components Used

1. **Navbar** - Responsive navigation with hamburger menu
2. **Navbar Toggler** - Mobile menu button
3. **Collapse** - Collapsible mobile menu
4. **Dropdown** - Support submenu
5. **Grid System** - Responsive row/col layout throughout
6. **Cards** - All card components across all pages
7. **Form Controls** - Contact form inputs, selects, textarea
8. **Buttons** - btn-success, btn-outline-success classes
9. **Utility Classes** - py-5, mb-4, text-center, d-flex, etc.

## What Changed

### Replaced with Bootstrap
- Custom flexbox navigation → Bootstrap Navbar
- Custom card grids → Bootstrap Grid + Card components
- Custom dropdown → Bootstrap Dropdown
- Custom form styling → Bootstrap Form controls
- Manual spacing → Bootstrap utility classes

### Kept Custom
- Green color scheme (#009000)
- Hero section design
- Card banner overlays
- Pseudo-element avatars
- Mission/impact box designs
- Footer styling
- Hover effects and animations

---

## CSS Reduction

- **Before Migration:** ~1000 lines custom CSS
- **After Migration:** ~850 lines (Bootstrap + brand overrides)
- **Net Reduction:** 15% (plus gained Bootstrap's responsive grid)

*Note: Higher than 60% target because custom branding (colors, hover effects, unique designs) requires override CSS. This is expected in real-world Bootstrap integrations.*

---

## Responsive Breakpoints

- **Desktop (lg):** 1200px+ - 3-4 items per row
- **Laptop (md):** 768px-1199px - 2-3 items per row  
- **Tablet (sm):** 576px-767px - 1-2 items per row
- **Mobile (xs):** <576px - 1 item per row, stacked layout

Hamburger menu appears at 992px breakpoint.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 4.5.2
- jQuery 3.5.1 (for Bootstrap JS)
- Popper.js 1.16.1 (for Bootstrap dropdowns)

---

## Key Improvements Over Vanilla Version

1. **Mobile Menu** - Hamburger navigation didn't exist before
2. **Responsive Grid** - Automatic breakpoint handling
3. **Equal Height Cards** - Bootstrap's h-100 utility
4. **Form Validation** - Bootstrap form states
5. **Utility Classes** - Rapid spacing/alignment adjustments
6. **Maintainability** - Standard Bootstrap patterns for future developers
