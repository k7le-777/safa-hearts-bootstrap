---

## Decisions Log

### Why Keep Custom Hero Section?
The hero section with background image and overlay is a unique brand element. Bootstrap doesn't provide a direct equivalent, so keeping custom CSS here makes sense.

### Why Keep Pseudo-element Avatars?
These demonstrate CSS pseudo-element skills and are simpler than adding actual images. Bootstrap has no avatar placeholder component.

### Why Override Bootstrap Colors?
The green color scheme is core to Safa Hearts brand identity. Bootstrap's default blue would require changing throughout.
