                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Safa Hearts began with a simple belief: compassion
                        is one of the most powerful forces for positive change.
                        Founded by someone who once needed help himself, Safa Hearts grew out of the support
                        and generosity he experienced. Inspired by the Islamic principle of sadaqah — voluntary
                        acts of charity and kindness — we work to make giving and caring a way of life for 
                        everyone. While our values are rooted in a rich tradition of service, our doors are 
                        open to all. We welcome every heart that wishes to help another, regardless of faith or
                        background. Together we can lift lives, ease hardship, and spread hope.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every day, we witness the ripple of kindness spreading through communities. One act of 
                        help sparks another, creating a chain of goodwill that touches countless lives. At Safa 
                        Hearts, we believe every small gesture matters, and every heart has the power to make a 
                        difference.
                    </p>

                        <h3>Ryan Burns - Founder</h3>
                        <p>Right now it’s just me — but change doesn’t need a crowd. It starts with one heart willing to act.
                            My journey began at home with small acts of kindness: caring for my family, then relatives, then 
                            travellers, neighbours and distant communities. It started with a simple smile — my first step toward purpose.
                            I had no money, so I gave what I could: time, effort, attention. No expectation, no recognition — only 
                            contentment in giving for the sake of Allah.
                            I’m not perfect; I strive to grow, to learn, and to act with sincerity at every opportunity. Safa Hearts 
                            exists to show that even the smallest act, done with intention, can ripple out and touch countless lives.
